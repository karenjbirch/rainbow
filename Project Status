What's the charity number? we need to review what's already out n the web
There is a proposal for using CPanel - when can this be finalised? we can have a sandbox and not yet push the page live.
Who is the 'decider' at Rainbow as to what goes ahead - we have Laura as a contact, but who does she report to for this purpose.  Trustee? Someone else?
